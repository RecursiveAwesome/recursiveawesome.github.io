## What's this AIoT Stuff?
We have written [an article](/blog/aiot) on what the AIoT is - but suffice to say, this is the next gneration of the Internet of Things. One in which you **can't ignore the data**. If you dn't use thie data and build smarter systems, mobile applications and interfaces, you will lose the race with your competition.

This is where we come in!

We help you assess once you have this data, what are the business use cases that we can help your flesh out, what is the newest technology in Machine Learning and deploying it to a gateway, an iPhones or Android devices or any other computing within your network and someting yuo can stop with us at any tme.
